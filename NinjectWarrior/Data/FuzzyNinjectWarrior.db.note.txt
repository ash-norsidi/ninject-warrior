SQLite format 3

-- This is a placeholder for the SQLite database.
-- In a real project, this file would be generated and managed by your ORM (e.g., Entity Framework) or created via migrations/scripts.
-- For demonstration, you may initialize your schema using a tool like DB Browser for SQLite or via code-first migrations.

-- Example (not executable in this file):
-- Players table
CREATE TABLE Players (
    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Name TEXT NOT NULL,
    Health INTEGER NOT NULL,
    Weapon INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Enemies table
CREATE TABLE Enemies (
    Name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    Health INTEGER NOT NULL
);
